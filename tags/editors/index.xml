      <description>Python is a fun language to code and we all need some editor/IDE for that. Few prefer vi, while few are in love with vs code. PyCharm is ruling if we talk about IDEs.
My personal favorite editor is Emacs. Hands down! Emacs is more than 40 years old and it is still one of most advanced editor out there.</description>
