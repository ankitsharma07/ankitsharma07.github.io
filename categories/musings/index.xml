      <description>June is the most exciting month for me. Every year Apple organises its World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June. I am a big Apple fan, been watching these since 2014 and now its almost 11 years and the level of excitement hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed a bit.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I have acquired this domain and thought about consistent writing. But, I kept procrastinating. I always felt what exactly should I write, and as I am queering my career in tech, I have plenty to express and write about now.</description>
